Our aim is to ensure that the development of the game is regular and stable. To achieve this, we need to respect certain rules and take the time to communicate.

# #1 Find a ticket

You can go to the issues DashBoard, And find any `ticket:open`. At this point read and ask question about the feature. If you think you can resolve the issue then ask to be assigned to it.

# #2 Start to implements.

If you have read the set up documentation you supposed to be at the dev branch on your directory. If not `git switch dev` gonna help you. At this point you can create a branch.

> The brakets `{...}` it is something you supposed to replace.

`git chekcout -b {annotation}` with the good annotation :

- `Feature/{name of the feature}`
- `Bug/{Bug to resolve}`
- `Documentation/{Documentation to update}`

# #3 Create a pull Request

At this stage of the project, we need to improve and see what's best. So ask for a pull request as you wish, and in the future we'll make it more precise.
